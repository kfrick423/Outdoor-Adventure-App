# Outdoor Adventure Planner

This application pulls data from third party API, https://www.google.com/maps, https://www.wunderground.com/, https://www.hikingproject.com/, and https://www.mountainproject.com/

## Motivation
I wanted to make finding trails and climbing routes accessible, while also relaying the weather forecast.
